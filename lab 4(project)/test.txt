visualizing student model:
this will give the moiu per class as well as the average miou
it will then show the image with the best iou and the image with the worst iou along with ground truth and predicted masks
it will then ask you to enter an index and show the corresponding image with ground truth and predicted masks

timing code:
note: deterministic settings are enabled to ensure that no optimizations skew the timing results
these settings makes the miou calculation slightly lower
